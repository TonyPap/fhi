# About the Forum

The Forum on Health Care Innovation is a collaboration between [Harvard Business School]({{gsheets.links.hbs-main.url}}) (HBS) and [Harvard Medical School]({{gsheets.links.hms-main.url}}) (HMS). Its purpose is to unite leading executives, policymakers, and academics in a cross-disciplinary exploration of innovative actions to improve quality, reduce costs, and, ultimately, increase value in the health care industry.

To help promote this conversation, the Forum's [initial event]({{gsheets.links.conference-2012-main.url}}) was a conference and survey that was summarized in [Five Key Imperatives]({{gsheets.links.conference-2012-5-imperatives.url}}).

The Forum has now launched the [Health Acceleration Challenge]({{gsheets.links.challenge-main.url}}) to identify and promote demonstrated health care innovations. Find out more and [apply today]({{gsheets.links.challenge-application.url}})!

<!-- quote from nohria -->
> I discovered both the enormous gratitude each one of us has as individuals for healthcare and the equally enormous frustration any one of us has as a consumer of the healthcare system. The challenge of this conference is: How can we realize the great magic, and the great benefits, that healthcare can afford?

<!-- quote from flier -->
> We need approaches to the solutions that arenâ€™t just arithmetic and additive, but are in some sense logarithmic. This will require us to reach across historic boundaries and unlock the potential of collaboration across the usual disciplines.
