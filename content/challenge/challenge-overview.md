title: Health Acceleration Challenge Overview
---

#### Introduction

> We’re looking for proven ideas that have the potential to do great things for the US health care delivery system.  It is widely known that health care innovations are much slower to disseminate than comparable solutions in other industries.  We want to help speed up the process.  What’s your innovation?

> We are seeking health care innovations that have demonstrated value and the potential to scale rapidly to create broader impact. We are specifically interested in innovations that improve the value of the US health care delivery system by lowering cost, improving quality or improving access.

> Innovations must have credible, demonstrated evidence of their value proposition (such as cost savings, outcomes improvement, patient satisfaction etc.) and be at the cusp of scaling with a compelling dissemination plan.
