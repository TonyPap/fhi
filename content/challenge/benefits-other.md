### Connections

In addition to the press and marketing for the Health Acceleration Challenge and our Conference, the ideas of our finalists will be widely distributed to Harvard Business School and Harvard Medical School alumni (over [150,000] worldwide) driving name recognition allowing you to scale quickly.

### Financial Award 

Our finalists will split $150,000 depending on their funding needs as determined by our judges. Funding for finalists will be awarded in 2015 and an additional $50,000 will be awarded a year later to the organization that has had the most success scaling up.

### Community Feedback

Applicants receive invaluable feedback on their innovation and its scale up plan from a community of health care executives and entrepreneurs through our Health Acceleration Challenge platform. We hope our process will facilitate you finding new investors, customers and collaborators, even if you are not selected as a winner in our Challenge.

Sharing insightful comments on other people's ideas on the Health Acceleration Challenge platform **could earn you free tickets to our invite-only Conference** even if you are not a Challenge finalist.
