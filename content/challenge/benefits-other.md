### Exposure

In addition to the press and marketing for the Health Acceleration Challenge and our Conference, the ideas of our finalists will be widely distributed to alumni to help get your ideas out there. 

### Financial Award 

Our finalists will split ${{addCommas gsheets.snippets.challenge-prize-grand-amt.val}} as determined by our judges. Funding for finalists will be awarded in 2015 and an additional ${{addCommas gsheets.snippets.challenge-prize-one-year-later.val}} will be awarded a year later to the organization that has had the most success scaling up.

### Community Feedback

Applicants receive invaluable feedback on their innovation and its scale up plan from a community of health care executives and entrepreneurs through our Health Acceleration Challenge platform. We hope our process will facilitate you finding new investors, customers and collaborators, even if you are not selected as a finalist in our Challenge.

Sharing insightful comments on other people's ideas on the Health Acceleration Challenge platform **could earn you free tickets to our invite-only Conference** even if you are not a Challenge applicant.
