### What is the Forum on Health Care Innovation?

 The Forum on Health Care Innovation is collaboration between [Harvard Business School](http://www.hbs.edu/healthcare) (HBS) and [Harvard Medical School](http://hms.harvard.edu/) (HMS). Its purpose is to unite leading executives, policymakers, and academics in a cross-disciplinary exploration of innovative actions to improve quality, reduce costs, and, ultimately, increase value in the health care industry. 

### What is the Health Acceleration Challenge?

Our Challenge aims to identify and promote innovations that have credible, demonstrated evidence to generate significant value for the US health care delivery system. In particular, we are looking for proven ideas that have yet to be widely disseminated and could benefit from access to Harvard's faculty and alumni and the senior health care leaders attending the Forum on Health Care Innovation conference in April 2015.

### What do you mean by "demonstrated value" and "potential to scale rapidly"?

We want to see credible evidence from existing sites, pilots or customers that your innovation works. The more evidence you can provide, the stronger your application. Your innovation does not necessarily have to be in final product form for commercialization, but you need to provide a credible dissemination plan of how you will overcome barriers to adoption across the US.

### What are examples of "credible evidence"?

It could be many things such as quantitative data from existing pilots showing improved patient outcomes over baseline, customer satisfaction data, or cost savings documentation.

### Are participants supposed to solve a specific problem?

Innovation and value creation for health care delivery can come in many shapes and sizes from process improvement and new business models to software or hardware innovations. As a result, we want you to tell us how your innovation has created value for patients, customers or the delivery system and why your idea will be able to transform US health care delivery.

### What are the benefits of participating?

Finalists of our Health Acceleration Challenge will meet senior health care leaders and Harvard faculty at our invitation-only conference in April 2015. If you are a finalist, your innovation will be discussed during a case discussion led by senior Harvard faculty and you will have the opportunity to meet with potential customers, investors and partners at the conference dinner. Finalists will also benefit from announcements to over [150,000] HBS and HMS alumni, and up to $150,000.

### How do teams apply?

### How is this different from other Challenges?

We believe innovations need to spread faster. We are focused on speeding up the adoption of innovations that have already demonstrated value and could benefit from wider dissemination through the powerful combination of the participants in the Forum on Health Care Innovation and the Harvard faculty and alumni network.

### What are examples of ideas you are looking for?

Ideas and programs (such as checklists, standard processes, or best practices) tried and tested in one health system and from which other health systems could benefit

*   Improved methods of involving patients leading to more efficient care or better outcomes
*   Innovative organizational forms or process technologies that increase quality, reduce cost, or increase patient convenience
*   Innovative methods for overcoming barriers to diffusion

### Do I have to be a for-profit entity?

No. For-profit and non-profit ideas are welcomed for consideration.

### Do I have to be based in the US or Boston?

No, you can be based anywhere in the world but your solution needs to be applicable to the US health care delivery system and you need to have a credible plan on how to deliver your solution in the US market.

### What are you not looking for?

Pharmaceutical, biotech, medical device, and diagnostic technologies may not be the best fit for this challenge unless they have demonstrated impact on improving care delivery processes beyond typical product interventions.

### What level of maturity are you looking for?

The application is open to any organization or solution ranging from nearly developed to fully developed to the early stages of deployment. However, you need credible demonstrated evidence that your solution can significantly impact the US health care delivery system.

### What criteria will the Judging Committee use?

Our judging panel will evaluate applications based on impact and value creation potential, dissemination plan, credible evidence of idea, and other participants' comments.

### I am not a Harvard alumnus, can I still apply?

Absolutely! Anyone can participate in our Challenge.

### I want to participate but don't have an innovation. How much time and effort does it take to be a part of a challenge?

Participants can contribute on a variety of levels, ranging from applauding ideas to contributing complex concepts. Being a part of our Challenge requires anywhere from a few minutes to many hours. It's totally up to you!
