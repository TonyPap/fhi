### Advise

We believe in the power of community-driven innovation to create better ideas together. That is why we all applications are available for everyone to see and comment on.

### Refine

Applications must be submitted at the Health Acceleration Challenge platform. You will need to register before you can access the application form. The application will require you to fill out information on the innovation and evidence that it works.

Once you have submitted your application, you will also have the opportunity to comment on other applicant's ideas, in fact it is part of the judging criteria! While applications close on {{challenge.application.due.month-day}}, you can continue commenting until end of October.

### Announce

A shortlist of round 1 applicants will be taken into round 2 and announced on the Health Acceleration platform mid-October. Round 2 applicants will present their innovations live in Boston or by via video-conference to the judging panel in the early November. This 30 minute session will give applicants the opportunity to present evidence in more detail and respond to questions from the judging panel.

We will then announce the 3 to 5 finalists in early December.

### Criteria

Judging criteria will be based on: 

* **Impact —** We will evaluate applications on their potential to improve the value of the US healthcare delivery system by lowering cost, improving quality, and/or improving access. We are looking for tested innovations that, if more broadly disseminated, would dramatically improve health care value.

* **Evidence —** We ask for credible information from existing sites, pilots or customers that your innovation works. The more evidence you can provide, the stronger your application.

* **Dissemination —** We want to know about your scale-up plan. What other sites, partners or customers do you intend to engage or have you already lined up? What are the barriers to adoption? What’s the timeline? Your innovation does not necessarily have to be in final form, but you need a solid dissemination plan.
