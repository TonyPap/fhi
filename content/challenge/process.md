### Advise

We believe in the power of community-driven innovation to create better ideas together. That is why we all applications are available for everyone to see and comment on.

### Refine
Applications must be submitted at the Health Acceleration Challenge platform. You will need to register before you can access the application form. The application will require you to fill out information on the innovation and evidence that it works.

Once you have submitted your application, you will also have the opportunity to comment on other applicant's ideas, in fact it is part of the judging criteria! While applications close on September 29, you can continue commenting until end of October.

### Announce
A shortlist of round 1 applicants will be taken into round 2 and announced on the Health Acceleration platform mid-October. Round 2 applicants will present their innovations live in Boston or by via video-conference to the judging panel in the early November. This 30 minute session will give applicants the opportunity to present evidence in more detail and respond to questions from the judging panel.

We will then announce the 3 to 5 finalists in early December.
