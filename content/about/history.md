Less was created in 2009 by <a href="https://github.com/cloudhead">Alexis Sellier</a>, more commonly known as <a href="https://twitter.com/cloudhead">@cloudhead</a>. Originally written in Ruby, it was then ported to JavaScript.

In May 2012 Alexis relinquished control and development over to a core team of contributors who now manage, fix and extend the language.
