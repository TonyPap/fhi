<p> The Forum on Health Care Innovation is collaboration between <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/healthcare">Harvard Business School</a> (HBS) and <a href="http://hms.harvard.edu/">Harvard Medical School</a> (HMS). Its purpose is to unite leading executives, policymakers, and academics in a cross-disciplinary exploration of innovative actions to improve quality, reduce costs, and, ultimately, increase value in the health care industry. </p>
<h3 class="docs-heading">What is the Health Acceleration Challenge?<span class="anchor-target" id="faqs-feature-what-is-the-health-acceleration-challenge-"></span>
<a href="#faqs-feature-what-is-the-health-acceleration-challenge-" name="faqs-feature-what-is-the-health-acceleration-challenge-" class="anchor glyphicon glyphicon-link"></a></h3>
<p>Our Challenge aims to identify and promote innovations that have credible, demonstrated evidence to generate significant value for the US health care delivery system. In particular, we are looking for proven ideas that have yet to be widely disseminated and could benefit from access to Harvard&#39;s faculty and alumni and the senior health care leaders attending the Forum on Health Care Innovation conference in April 2015.</p>
<h3 class="docs-heading">What do you mean by &quot;demonstrated value&quot; and &quot;potential to scale rapidly&quot;?<span class="anchor-target" id="faqs-feature-what-do-you-mean-by-demonstrated-value-and-potential-to-scale-rapidly-"></span>

<p>We want to see credible evidence from existing sites, pilots or customers that your innovation works. The more evidence you can provide, the stronger your application. Your innovation does not necessarily have to be in final product form for commercialization, but you need to provide a credible dissemination plan of how you will overcome barriers to adoption across the US.</p>
<h3 class="docs-heading">What are examples of &quot;credible evidence&quot;?<span class="anchor-target" id="faqs-feature-what-are-examples-of-credible-evidence-"></span>
<a href="#faqs-feature-what-are-examples-of-credible-evidence-" name="faqs-feature-what-are-examples-of-credible-evidence-" class="anchor glyphicon glyphicon-link"></a></h3>
<p>It could be many things such as quantitative data from existing pilots showing improved patient outcomes over baseline, customer satisfaction data, or cost savings documentation.</p>

<p>Innovation and value creation for health care delivery can come in many shapes and sizes from process improvement and new business models to software or hardware innovations. As a result, we want you to tell us how your innovation has created value for patients, customers or the delivery system and why your idea will be able to transform US health care delivery.</p>

<p>Finalists of our Health Acceleration Challenge will meet senior health care leaders and Harvard faculty at our invitation-only conference in April 2015. If you are a finalist, your innovation will be discussed during a case discussion led by senior Harvard faculty and you will have the opportunity to meet with potential customers, investors and partners at the conference dinner. Finalists will also benefit from announcements to over [150,000] HBS and HMS alumni, and up to $150,000.</p>

<p>We believe innovations need to spread faster.

<p>Ideas and programs (such as checklists, standard processes, or best practices) tried and tested in one health system and from which other health systems could benefit</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved methods of involving patients leading to more efficient care or better outcomes</li>
<li>Innovative organizational forms or process technologies that increase quality, reduce cost, or increase patient convenience</li>
<li>Innovative methods for overcoming barriers to diffusion</li>

<p>No, you can be based anywhere in the world but your solution needs to be applicable to the US health care delivery system and you need to have a credible plan on how to deliver your solution in the US market.</p>
